### Who is our audience?

- not for profit organizations (for grants)
- Big enterprise organizations needing help with scope
- Open source community, engineers
- Academics, researchers, information science

### Who are we?

- Experienced UI/UX designers and researchers
- We spend most of our time explaining ourselves to clients
- We recognize the need and help reduce the learning curve
- We’re being proactive and trying to do the work of explaining
- Incorporate some real science into design
- Help users/clients understand the need for a design process that works
- A think tank
- Org to clarify design process for technical teams
- The “cat’s jump”

### Goals

- Control the narrative
- Selling a methodology
- Case studies to support the methodology
- (also a portfolio for us)
- A philosophy

Design process has been conducted behind closed doors: very rarely if ever in the open. Invisible to users, so that users think that the design phase is the last phase in the process, when in fact it runs all the way through. People think that design is magic because it is so invisible.

Questions to answer per project
- What’s our audience?



Needs:

Control of the narrative

Control the presentation of ideas

Academic presentation pointing at corporations



Presentation:

To be responsible for something you can’t control is a source of stress.

The goal is to shift the narrative from personal responsibility within a dysfunctional system.

Need to reframe this. “You missed this. What about that?”



PR machine:

Who do we want to be? How do we present ourselves?

Build a press kit - article, images, branding: a call to action

What do we want people to do? - actionables

Know that we exist

Send to relevant people/orgs

Find people whose skills will be valuable

A what-if article by way of proposal

Build on this and each successive project to build a reputation



Venues for articles:

Who is the audience?



Ideas:

Systemic design is like product design without a market.

Humans are just one node. Politics are another node. Systems/machines are another node. The locus/physical space is another. Etc. Systemic design deals with the relationships between these nodes.

Moving away from technology as the focus - even though the technology is the result of the process.

AI as its own animal: non-human intelligent agents (usually owned by corporations). This needs to be taken into account.



Homework:

N: Subway map

J: 1) Institutional identity/academic/legal aspects (What’s our manifesto?) & 2) think of ways to write this up in a compelling way
